## 📖 Project Introduction

**PiPiClaw** is a personal AI copilot that runs on your own device. It follows the OpenAI API specification: the default example uses Qwen, but you can plug in any OpenAI-compatible LLM (OpenAI/Azure OpenAI, Qwen/DashScope, DeepSeek, Moonshot, SiliconFlow, Together AI, etc.). It stays lightweight and always-on, pairing the terminal with a built-in Web console to render the commands and task board you control across Windows, macOS, and Linux. The gateway is merely the management surface—the real assistant lives locally beside you.

- Beyond DevOps: a full-spectrum local agent that can orchestrate development, automation, data handling, knowledge search, and more.
- Native Skill-Hub integration lets you search and install 10,000+ ecosystem skills with one click to expand capabilities without limits.

> Recommended setup: run `dotnet run` directly in the terminal and follow the first-run guide to set your API Key, model, and the Web console (any OpenAI-compatible provider works). You can also publish a self-contained AOT build (`dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64|osx-x64|linux-x64 --self-contained true`) and run it instantly on macOS, Linux, or Windows (including WSL2). New installations can start with the “Quick Start” section below.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 10.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or higher
- Any **OpenAI-compatible** API Key (examples: OpenAI/Azure OpenAI, Alibaba Cloud DashScope, DeepSeek, Moonshot, SiliconFlow, Together AI, etc.)

### Installation & Running

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/anan1213095357/PiPiClaw.git
cd PiPiClaw

# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Run the project
dotnet run
```

On first run, `appsettings.json` will be automatically generated. Follow the prompts to enter your API Key.

### Publish as Standalone Executable

```bash
# Publish AOT compiled version (single file, high performance)
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true
dotnet publish -c Release -r osx-x64 --self-contained true
dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained true
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Configuration File (appsettings.json)

> Generated on first run. The `Models` list supports adding multiple providers and switching from the Web UI dropdown.

```json
{
  "Models": [
    {
      "ApiKey": "sk-your-actual-api-key-here",
      "Model": "qwen3.5-plus",
      "Endpoint": "https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1/chat/completions"
    }
  ],
  "SudoPassword": "",
  "WebPort": 5050
}
```

| Config | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Models` | Model list; the first entry is default and can be switched live in the Web UI |
| `Models[].ApiKey` | Any OpenAI/compatible API Key (DashScope shown as an example) |
| `Models[].Model` | AI model to use (default example: qwen3.5-plus; fill in DeepSeek/Moonshot/GPT, etc.) |
| `Models[].Endpoint` | OpenAI-spec-compatible API endpoint URL |
| `SudoPassword` | (Optional) Auto-privilege password for Linux/macOS |
| `WebPort` | Web console port (default 5050) |

### Environment Variables

```bash
# macOS / Linux
export ApiKey="sk-your-api-key-here"
export Model="qwen3.5-plus"
export Endpoint="https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1/chat/completions"
export WebPort=5050
export SudoPassword=""

# Windows PowerShell
$env:ApiKey="sk-your-api-key-here"
$env:Model="qwen3.5-plus"
$env:Endpoint="https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1/chat/completions"
$env:WebPort="5050"
$env:SudoPassword=""
```

> Environment variable names match the config keys (case-sensitive), handy for containers or temporary overrides.

> The snippet above uses DashScope as an example. Replace `Model` and `Endpoint` with those from the OpenAI-compatible service you use (OpenAI/Azure, DeepSeek, Moonshot, etc.).

## 💡 Usage Examples

After starting PiPiClaw, you can input various natural language instructions:

### Basic Operations
```
> Help me scan the current directory for C# source files

> Read the contents of package.json and analyze dependencies

> Execute git status to check the current repository state

> Check the current memory usage of the system and write the result to memory_log.txt
```

### File Operations
```
> Create a configuration file named config.json containing database connection information

> Replace all Console.WriteLine with Debug.WriteLine in main.cs
```

### Scheduled Tasks
```
> Take a screenshot every day at 3 PM to see what I'm doing

> Check CPU usage every 30 minutes and log it if it exceeds 80%
```

### Skill Extensions
```
> Search for weather-related skills

> Install the calendar skill
```

2. **Command Execution Permissions**: Commands executed by the tool have the same permissions as the current user, please operate with caution
3. **Network Dependency**: Stable network connection is required to call AI services
4. **Token Limit**: Large file reading will be automatically truncated to prevent Token overflow
5. **File Modification**: When modifying existing files, please ensure to provide precise old_content for replacement
6. **Windows Privilege**: Windows environment cannot automatically handle sudo, please run the program as Administrator
